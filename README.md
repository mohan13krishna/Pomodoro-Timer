## üß† The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro," the Italian word for tomato (after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student).

### The Basic Process:
1. Decide on the task to be done
2. Set the timer for 25 minutes (one pomodoro)
3. Work on the task until the timer rings
4. Take a short break (5 minutes)
5. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes)

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Theme Colors

The application comes with three different theme colors:
- Focus Mode: Blue
- Short Break: Green
- Long Break: Purple

You can easily customize these colors by modifying the CSS variables in the `styles.css` file.
